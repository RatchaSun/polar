        <title>Emperor Penguin</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Emperor penguin is an animal that can survive coldest place on earth. Unlike polar bear, emperor penguin live in south pole. &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;//www.imdb.com/title/tt0428803/&quot;&gt;La marche de l’empereur&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is an award winning documentary film that’s will help you know them better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri) is the tallest and heaviest of all living penguin species and is endemic to Antarctica. The male and female are similar in plumage and size, reaching 122 cm (48 in) in height and weighing from 22 to 45 kg (49 to 99 lb). The dorsal side and head are black and sharply delineated from the white belly, pale-yellow breast and bright-yellow ear patches. Like all penguins it is flightless, with a streamlined body, and wings stiffened and flattened into flippers for a marine habitat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its diet consists primarily of fish, but can also include crustaceans, such as krill, and cephalopods, such as squid. In hunting, the species can remain submerged up to 18 minutes, diving to a depth of 535 m (1,755 ft). It has several adaptations to facilitate this, including an unusually structured haemoglobin to allow it to function at low oxygen levels, solid bones to reduce barotrauma, and the ability to reduce its metabolism and shut down non-essential organ functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only penguin species that breeds during the Antarctic winter, emperor penguins trek 50–120 km (31–75 mi) over the ice to breeding colonies which may include thousands of individuals. The female lays a single egg, which is incubated by the male while the female returns to the sea to feed; parents subsequently take turns foraging at sea and caring for their chick in the colony. The lifespan is typically 20 years in the wild, although observations suggest that some individuals may live to 50 years of age.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Aurora</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Aurora is a natural light in the sky. Occur near both poles of the planet with magnetic field. On earth, you need to go between 10°-20° degree from the geomagnetic poles, and wait until dark to easily observe. Its colors can vary from red to blue, but the most well known color is green.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An aurora, sometimes referred to as a polar light, is a natural light display in the sky, predominantly seen in the high latitude (Arctic and Antarctic) regions. Auroras are produced when the magnetosphere is sufficiently disturbed by the solar wind that the trajectories of charged particles in both solar wind and magnetospheric plasma, mainly in the form of electrons and protons, precipitate them into the upper atmosphere (thermosphere/exosphere), where their energy is lost. The resulting ionization and excitation of atmospheric constituents emits light of varying colour and complexity. The form of the aurora, occurring within bands around both polar regions, is also dependent on the amount of acceleration imparted to the precipitating particles. Precipitating protons generally produce optical emissions as incident hydrogen atoms after gaining electrons from the atmosphere. Proton auroras are usually observed at lower latitudes. Different aspects of an aurora are elaborated in various sections below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;occurrence-of-terrestrial-auroras&quot;&gt;Occurrence of terrestrial auroras&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most auroras occur in a band known as the auroral zone, which is typically 3° to 6° wide in latitude and between 10° and 20° from the geomagnetic poles at all local times (or longitudes), most clearly seen at night against a dark sky. A region that currently displays an aurora is called the auroral oval, a band displaced towards the nightside of the Earth. Day-to-day positions of the auroral ovals are posted on the internet. A geomagnetic storm causes the auroral ovals (north and south) to expand, and bring the aurora to lower latitudes. Early evidence for a geomagnetic connection comes from the statistics of auroral observations. Elias Loomis (1860), and later Hermann Fritz (1881) and S. Tromholt (1882) in more detail, established that the aurora appeared mainly in the “auroral zone”, a ring-shaped region with a radius of approximately 2500 km around the Earth’s magnetic pole. It was hardly ever seen near the geographic pole, which is about 2000 km away from the magnetic pole. The instantaneous distribution of auroras (“auroral oval”) is slightly different, being centered about 3–5 degrees nightward of the magnetic pole, so that auroral arcs reach furthest toward the equator when the magnetic pole in question is in between the observer and the Sun. The aurora can be seen best at this time, which is called magnetic midnight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In northern latitudes, the effect is known as the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;aurora borealis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (or the &lt;strong&gt;northern lights&lt;/strong&gt;), named after the Roman goddess of dawn, Aurora, and the Greek name for the north wind, Boreas, by Galileo in 1619. Auroras seen within the auroral oval may be directly overhead, but from farther away they illuminate the poleward horizon as a greenish glow, or sometimes a faint red, as if the Sun were rising from an unusual direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its southern counterpart, the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;aurora australis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (or the &lt;strong&gt;southern lights&lt;/strong&gt;), has features that are almost identical to the aurora borealis and changes simultaneously with changes in the northern auroral zone. It is visible from high southern latitudes in Antarctica, South America, New Zealand, and Australia. Auroras also occur on other planets. Similar to the Earth’s aurora, they are also visible close to the planets’ magnetic poles. Auroras also occur poleward of the auroral zone as either diffuse patches or arcs, which can be sub-visual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;planetary-auroras&quot;&gt;Planetary auroras&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Jupiter and Saturn have magnetic fields much stronger than Earth’s (Jupiter’s equatorial field strength is 4.3 gauss, compared to 0.3 gauss for Earth), and both have extensive radiation belts. Auroras have been observed on both, most clearly with the Hubble Space Telescope. Uranus and Neptune have also been observed to have auroras.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The auroras on the gas giants seem, like Earth’s, to be powered by the solar wind. In addition, however, Jupiter’s moons, especially Io, are powerful sources of auroras on Jupiter. These arise from electric currents along field lines (“field aligned currents”), generated by a dynamo mechanism due to the relative motion between the rotating planet and the moving moon. Io, which has active volcanism and an ionosphere, is a particularly strong source, and its currents also generate radio emissions, studied since 1955. Auroras also have been observed on the surfaces of Io, Europa, and Ganymede, using the Hubble Space Telescope. Auroras have also been observed on Venus and Mars. Because Venus has no intrinsic (planetary) magnetic field, Venusian auroras appear as bright and diffuse patches of varying shape and intensity, sometimes distributed across the full planetary disc. Venusian auroras are produced by the impact of electrons originating from the solar wind and precipitating in the night-side atmosphere. An aurora was also detected on Mars, on 14 August 2004, by the SPICAM instrument aboard Mars Express. The aurora was located at Terra Cimmeria, in the region of 177° East, 52° South. The total size of the emission region was about 30 km across, and possibly about 8 km high. By analyzing a map of crustal magnetic anomalies compiled with data from Mars Global Surveyor, scientists observed that the region of the emissions corresponded to an area where the strongest magnetic field is localized. This correlation indicates that the origin of the light emission was a flux of electrons moving along the crust magnetic lines and exciting the upper atmosphere of Mars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The brown dwarf star LSR J1835+3259 was discovered to have auroras in July 2015, the first extra-solar auroras discovered. The aurora is a million times brighter than the Northern Lights, mainly red in colour, because the charged particles are interacting with hydrogen in its atmosphere. It is not known what the cause is. Some have speculated that material maybe being stripped off the surface of the brown dwarf via stellar winds to produce its own electrons. Another possible explanation is an as-yet-undetected planet or moon around the dwarf, which is throwing off material to light it up, as is the case with Jupiter and its moon Io.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>North Pole</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;North Pole is where the polar bear live. The temperatures is in range from -50 to -13 °C. Within one year, the sun will stay on the sky for 6 months, and another 6 months will be night time. You can easily see the aurora light from January to March around this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The content of this article is excerpted from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Pole&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;. It exist here as a placeholder for layout development purpose.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The North Pole, also known as the Geographic North Pole or Terrestrial North Pole, is (subject to the caveats explained below) defined as the point in the Northern Hemisphere where the Earth’s axis of rotation meets its surface. It should not be confused with the North Magnetic Pole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The North Pole is the northernmost point on the Earth, lying diametrically opposite the South Pole. It defines geodetic latitude 90° North, as well as the direction of true north. At the North Pole all directions point south; all lines of longitude converge there, so its longitude can be defined as any degree value. Along tight latitude circles, counterclockwise is east and clockwise is west.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the South Pole lies on a continental land mass, the North Pole is located in the middle of the Arctic Ocean amid waters that are almost permanently covered with constantly shifting sea ice. This makes it impractical to construct a permanent station at the North Pole (unlike the South Pole). However, the Soviet Union, and later Russia, constructed a number of manned drifting stations on a generally annual basis since 1937, some of which have passed over or very close to the Pole. Since 2002, the Russians have also annually established a base, Barneo, close to the Pole. This operates for a few weeks during early spring. Studies in the 2000s predicted that the North Pole may become seasonally ice-free because of Arctic ice shrinkage, with timescales varying from 2016 to the late 21st century or later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sea depth at the North Pole has been measured at 4,261 m (13,980 ft) by the Russian Mir submersible in 2007 and at 4,087 m (13,410 ft) by USS Nautilus in 1958. The nearest land is usually said to be Kaffeklubben Island, off the northern coast of Greenland about 700 km (430 mi) away, though some perhaps non-permanent gravel banks lie slightly closer. The nearest permanently inhabited place is Alert in the Qikiqtaaluk Region, Nunavut, Canada, which is located 817 km (508 mi) from the Pole.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Polar Bear</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Polar bear is a cute white creature live in North Pole. To survive extream cold temperature, it has to develope large thick fur to cover its entire body. Its baby must be born with large body or it will be freeze to death. Favorite diet are fish and seals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/polar/images/polar-bear-posture.png&quot; alt=&quot;Picture from Wikimedia -- Ursus maritimus posture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The content of this article is excerpted from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_bear&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;. It exist here as a placeholder for layout development purpose.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;polar bear&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Ursus maritimus&lt;/em&gt;) is a carnivorous bear whose native range lies largely within the Arctic Circle, encompassing the Arctic Ocean, its surrounding seas and surrounding land masses. It is a large bear, approximately the same size as the omnivorous Kodiak bear (Ursus arctos middendorffi). A boar (adult male) weighs around 350–700 kg (772–1,543 lb), while a sow (adult female) is about half that size. Although it is the sister species of the brown bear, it has evolved to occupy a narrower ecological niche, with many body characteristics adapted for cold temperatures, for moving across snow, ice, and open water, and for hunting seals, which make up most of its diet. Although most polar bears are born on land, they spend most of their time on the sea ice. Their scientific name means “maritime bear”, and derives from this fact. Polar bears hunt their preferred food of seals from the edge of sea ice, often living off fat reserves when no sea ice is present. Because of their dependence on the sea ice, polar bears are classified as marine mammals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of expected habitat loss caused by climate change, the polar bear is classified as a vulnerable species, and at least three of the nineteen polar bear subpopulations are currently in decline. For decades, large-scale hunting raised international concern for the future of the species but populations rebounded after controls and quotas began to take effect. For thousands of years, the polar bear has been a key figure in the material, spiritual, and cultural life of circumpolar peoples, and polar bears remain important in their cultures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;naming-and-etymology&quot;&gt;Naming and etymology&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Constantine John Phipps was the first to describe the polar bear as a distinct species in 1774. He chose the scientific name Ursus maritimus, the Latin for ‘maritime bear’, due to the animal’s native habitat. The Inuit refer to the animal as nanook (transliterated as nanuq in the Inupiat language). The Yupik also refer to the bear as nanuuk in Siberian Yupik. The bear is umka in the Chukchi language. In Russian, it is usually called бе́лый медве́дь (bélyj medvédj, the white bear), though an older word still in use is ошку́й (Oshkúj, which comes from the Komi oski, “bear”). In French, the polar bear is referred to as ours blanc (“white bear”) or ours polaire (“polar bear”). In the Norwegian-administered Svalbard archipelago, the polar bear is referred to as Isbjørn (“ice bear”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The polar bear was previously considered to be in its own genus, Thalarctos. However, evidence of hybrids between polar bears and brown bears, and of the recent evolutionary divergence of the two species, does not support the establishment of this separate genus, and the accepted scientific name is now therefore Ursus maritimus, as Phipps originally proposed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;biology-and-behaviour&quot;&gt;Biology and behaviour&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;physical-characteristics&quot;&gt;Physical characteristics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only other bear of a similar size to the polar bear is the Kodiak bear, which is a subspecies of brown bear. Adult male polar bears weigh 350–700 kg (772–1,543 lb) and measure 2.4–3 metres (7 ft 10 in–9 ft 10 in) in total length. The Guinness Book of World Records listed the average male as having a body mass of 385 to 410 kg (849 to 904 lb) and a shoulder height of 133 cm (4 ft 4 in), slightly smaller than the average male Kodiak bears. Around the Beaufort Sea, however, mature males reportedly average 450 kg (992 lb). Adult females are roughly half the size of males and normally weigh 150–250 kg (331–551 lb), measuring 1.8–2.4 metres (5 ft 11 in–7 ft 10 in) in length. Elsewhere, a slightly larger estimated average weight of 260 kg (573 lb) was claimed for adult females. When pregnant, however, females can weigh as much as 500 kg (1,102 lb). The polar bear is among the most sexually dimorphic of mammals, surpassed only by the pinnipeds such as elephant seals. The largest polar bear on record, reportedly weighing 1,002 kg (2,209 lb), was a male shot at Kotzebue Sound in northwestern Alaska in 1960. This specimen, when mounted, stood 3.39 m (11 ft 1 in) tall on its hindlegs. The shoulder height of an adult polar bear is 122 to 160 cm (4 ft 0 in to 5 ft 3 in). While all bears are short-tailed, the polar bear’s tail is relatively the shortest amongst living bears, ranging from 7 to 13 cm (2.8 to 5.1 in) in length.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared with its closest relative, the brown bear, the polar bear has a more elongated body build and a longer skull and nose. As predicted by Allen’s rule for a northerly animal, the legs are stocky and the ears and tail are small. However, the feet are very large to distribute load when walking on snow or thin ice and to provide propulsion when swimming; they may measure 30 cm (12 in) across in an adult. The pads of the paws are covered with small, soft papillae (dermal bumps), which provide traction on the ice. The polar bear’s claws are short and stocky compared to those of the brown bear, perhaps to serve the former’s need to grip heavy prey and ice. The claws are deeply scooped on the underside to assist in digging in the ice of the natural habitat. Research of injury patterns in polar bear forelimbs found injuries to the right forelimb to be more frequent than those to the left, suggesting, perhaps, right-handedness. Unlike the brown bear, polar bears in captivity are rarely overweight or particularly large, possibly as a reaction to the warm conditions of most zoos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 42 teeth of a polar bear reflect its highly carnivorous diet. The cheek teeth are smaller and more jagged than in the brown bear, and the canines are larger and sharper. The dental formula is $ \frac{3.1.4.2}{3.1.4.3} $&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polar bears are superbly insulated by up to 10 cm (4 in) of adipose tissue, their hide and their fur; they overheat at temperatures above 10 °C (50 °F), and are nearly invisible under infrared photography. Polar bear fur consists of a layer of dense underfur and an outer layer of guard hairs, which appear white to tan but are actually transparent. The guard hair is 5–15 cm (2–6 in) over most of the body. Polar bears gradually moult from May to August, but, unlike other Arctic mammals, they do not shed their coat for a darker shade to camouflage themselves in the summer conditions. The hollow guard hairs of a polar bear coat were once thought to act as fiber-optic tubes to conduct light to its black skin, where it could be absorbed; however, this hypothesis was disproved by a study in 1998.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The white coat usually yellows with age. When kept in captivity in warm, humid conditions, the fur may turn a pale shade of green due to algae growing inside the guard hairs. Males have significantly longer hairs on their forelegs, which increase in length until the bear reaches 14 years of age. The male’s ornamental foreleg hair is thought to attract females, serving a similar function to the lion’s mane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The polar bear has an extremely well developed sense of smell, being able to detect seals nearly 1.6 km (1 mi) away and buried under 1 m (3 ft) of snow. Its hearing is about as acute as that of a human, and its vision is also good at long distances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The polar bear is an excellent swimmer and often will swim for days. One bear swam continuously for 9 days in the frigid Bering Sea for 400 mi (687 km) to reach ice far from land. She then travelled another 1,100 mi (1,800 km). During the swim, the bear lost 22% of her body mass and her yearling cub died. With its body fat providing buoyancy, the bear swims in a dog paddle fashion using its large forepaws for propulsion. Polar bears can swim 10 km/h (6 mph). When walking, the polar bear tends to have a lumbering gait and maintains an average speed of around 5.6 km/h (3.5 mph). When sprinting, they can reach up to 40 km/h (25 mph).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hunting-and-diet&quot;&gt;Hunting and diet&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The polar bear is the most carnivorous member of the bear family, and throughout most of its range, its diet primarily consists of ringed (Pusa hispida) and bearded seals (Erignathus barbatus). The Arctic is home to millions of seals, which become prey when they surface in holes in the ice in order to breathe, or when they haul out on the ice to rest. Polar bears hunt primarily at the interface between ice, water, and air; they only rarely catch seals on land or in open water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The polar bear’s most common hunting method is called still-hunting: The bear uses its excellent sense of smell to locate a seal breathing hole, and crouches nearby in silence for a seal to appear. The bear may lay in wait for several hours. When the seal exhales, the bear smells its breath, reaches into the hole with a forepaw, and drags it out onto the ice. The polar bear kills the seal by biting its head to crush its skull. The polar bear also hunts by stalking seals resting on the ice: Upon spotting a seal, it walks to within 90 m (100 yd), and then crouches. If the seal does not notice, the bear creeps to within 9 to 12 m (30 to 40 ft) of the seal and then suddenly rushes forth to attack. A third hunting method is to raid the birth lairs that female seals create in the snow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A widespread legend tells that polar bears cover their black noses with their paws when hunting. This behaviour, if it happens, is rare – although the story exists in the oral history of northern peoples and in accounts by early Arctic explorers, there is no record of an eyewitness account of the behaviour in recent decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mature bears tend to eat only the calorie-rich skin and blubber of the seal, which are highly digestible, whereas younger bears consume the protein-rich red meat. Studies have also photographed polar bears scaling near-vertical cliffs, to eat birds’ chicks and eggs. For subadult bears, which are independent of their mother but have not yet gained enough experience and body size to successfully hunt seals, scavenging the carcasses from other bears’ kills is an important source of nutrition. Subadults may also be forced to accept a half-eaten carcass if they kill a seal but cannot defend it from larger polar bears. After feeding, polar bears wash themselves with water or snow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although polar bears are extraordinarily powerful, its primary prey species, the ringed seal, is much smaller than itself, and many of the seals hunted are pups rather than adults. Ringed seals are born weighing 5.4 kg (12 lb) and grown to an estimated average weight of only 60 kg (130 lb). They also in places prey heavily upon the harp seal (Pusa groenlandica) or the harbor seal. The bearded seal, on the other hand, can be nearly the same size as the bear itself, averaging 270 kg (600 lb). Adult male bearded seals, at 350 to 500 kg (770 to 1,100 lb) are too large for a female bear to overtake, and so are potential prey only for mature male bears. Large males also occasionally attempt to hunt and kill even larger prey items. It can kill an adult walrus (Odobenus rosmarus), although this is rarely attempted. At up to 2,000 kg (4,400 lb) and a typical adult mass range of 600 to 1,500 kg (1,300 to 3,300 lb), a walrus can be more than twice the bear’s weight, and has up to 1-metre (3 ft)-long ivory tusks that can be used as formidable weapons. A polar bear may charge a group of walruses, with the goal of separating a young, infirm, or injured walrus from the pod. They will even attack adult walruses when their diving holes have frozen over or intercept them before they can get back to the diving hole in the ice. Yet, polar bears will very seldom attack full-grown adult walruses, with the largest male walrus probably invulnerable unless otherwise injured or incapacitated. Since an attack on a walrus tends to be an extremely protracted and exhausting venture, bears have been known to back down from the attack after making the initial injury to the walrus. Polar bears have also been seen to prey on beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) and narwhals (Monodon monoceros), by swiping at them at breathing holes. The whales are of similar size to the walrus and nearly as difficult for the bear to subdue. Most terrestrial animals in the Arctic can outrun the polar bear on land as polar bears overheat quickly, and most marine animals the bear encounters can outswim it. In some areas, the polar bear’s diet is supplemented by walrus calves and by the carcasses of dead adult walruses or whales, whose blubber is readily devoured even when rotten. Polar bears sometimes like to go fishing where they swim underwater to catch fish like the Arctic charr or the fourhorn sculpin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the exception of pregnant females, polar bears are active year-round, although they have a vestigial hibernation induction trigger in their blood. Unlike brown and black bears, polar bears are capable of fasting for up to several months during late summer and early fall, when they cannot hunt for seals because the sea is unfrozen. When sea ice is unavailable during summer and early autumn, some populations live off fat reserves for months at a time, as polar bears do not ‘hibernate’ any time of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being both curious animals and scavengers, polar bears investigate and consume garbage where they come into contact with humans. Polar bears may attempt to consume almost anything they can find, including hazardous substances such as styrofoam, plastic, car batteries, ethylene glycol, hydraulic fluid, and motor oil. The dump in Churchill, Manitoba was closed in 2006 to protect bears, and waste is now recycled or transported to Thompson, Manitoba.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dietary-flexibility&quot;&gt;Dietary flexibility&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although seal predation is the primary and an indispensable way of life for most polar bears, when alternatives are present they are quite flexible. Polar bears will consume a wide variety of other wild foods, including muskox (Ovibos moschatus), reindeer (Rangifer tarandus), birds, eggs, rodents, crabs, other crustaceans and other polar bears. They may also eat plants, including berries, roots, and kelp, however none of these are a significant part of their diet, except that beachcast marine mammal carcasses are an exception. When stalking land animals, such as muskox, reindeer, and even willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus), polar bears appear to make use of vegetative cover and wind direction to bring them as close to their prey as possible before attacking. Polar bears have been observed to hunt the small Svalbard reindeer (R. t. platyrhynchus), which weigh only 40 to 60 kg (90 to 130 lb) as adults, as well as the barren-ground caribou (R. t. groenlandicus), which is about twice as heavy as that. Adult muskox, which can weigh 450 kg (1,000 lb) or more, are a more formidable quarry. Although ungulates are not typical prey, the killing of one during the summer months can greatly increase the odds of survival during that lean period. Like the brown bear, most ungulate prey of polar bears is likely to be young, sickly or injured specimens rather than healthy adults. The polar bear’s biology is specialized to require large amounts of fat from marine mammals, and it cannot derive sufficient caloric intake from terrestrial food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their southern range, especially near Hudson Bay and James Bay, Canadian polar bears endure all summer without sea ice to hunt from. Here, their food ecology shows their dietary flexibility. They still manage to consume some seals, but they are food-deprived in summer as only marine mammal carcasses are an important alternative without sea ice, especially carcasses of the beluga whale. These alternatives may reduce the rate of weight loss of bears when on land. One scientist found that 71% of the Hudson Bay bears had fed on seaweed (marine algae) and that about half were feeding on birds like sea ducks, especially the oldsquaw (53%), common eider, long-tailed duck or dovekie by swimming underwater to catch them. They were also diving to feed on blue mussels and other underwater food sources like the green sea urchin. 24% had eaten moss recently, 19% had consumed grass, 34% had eaten black crowberry and about half had consumed willows. This study illustrates the polar bear’s dietary flexibility but it does not represent its life history elsewhere. Most polar bears elsewhere will never have access to these alternatives, except for the marine mammal carcasses that are important wherever they occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Svalbard, polar bears were observed to kill white-beaked dolphins during spring, when the dolphins were trapped in the sea ice. The bears then proceeded to cache the carcasses, which remained and were eaten during the ice-free summer and autumn.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;This post show various results from Markdown techniques. Specifily, it’s &lt;a href=&quot;//kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html&quot;&gt;kramdown&lt;/a&gt; plus &lt;a href=&quot;//github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet&quot;&gt;GFM&lt;/a&gt;! And you need to calm down if you only know just Standard Markdown, because you can use it right away without changing you old code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you want to learn more, see this file source&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:filepath&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:filepath&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; for more information on the syntax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;infobox&quot;&gt;
  &lt;h2 id=&quot;attributes&quot;&gt;Attributes&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Great feature of kramdown is it able to add HTML attribute into elements. To do this, just place &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;{: [attributes]}&lt;/code&gt; right after inline element, or above/below of a paragraph on block element.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Here is a list of attributes provide by this theme:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Box decoration:
      &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.infobox&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.spoiler&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Floating:
      &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.float-left&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.float-right&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.clear-float&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Text alignments:
      &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.text-left&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.text-right&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Content separate lines:
      &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.sep-left&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.sep-right&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.sep-top&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.sep-bottom&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;image&quot;&gt;Image&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/polar/images/800x400.png&quot; alt=&quot;800px x400px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/polar/images/100x100.png&quot; alt=&quot;100px x100px&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; /&gt;
This above image is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; displayed at the width of 800 pixel, but will take up horizontal spaces as much as the width of content wrapper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While on the rightside is a floating image. If you want it to stop consuming float area, make a paragraph with class &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;clear-float&lt;/code&gt;, where you want to shift next elements down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;clear-float&quot;&gt;An image without floating attribute will align itself to the center of the current page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;table&quot;&gt;Table&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Codice&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Curabitur&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;Nos&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Alpha&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;libero et diam facilisis.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;23&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Beta&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;vulputate quam ac.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;42&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Pi&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;semper eget sit amet mi.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;314&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
  &lt;tfoot&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Omega&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;summa&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;379&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tfoot&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;code&quot;&gt;Code&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Code without language specify will not be highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;1.to 3 do |number|
    puts &quot;I can count to #{number}.&quot;
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compare to code with language specify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-haskell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;factorial&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Integer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Integer&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;factorial&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tailfact&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;acc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;acc&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tailfact&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;acc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tailfact&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;acc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tailfact&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since GFM doesn’t directly support line numbering&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:linenos&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:linenos&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, add this class to call JavaScript to decorate code block with line numbers instead:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript linenos highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;window&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;onload&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ln&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getElementsByClassName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;linenos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that line numbering will not work on client machine that disable JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;math&quot;&gt;Math&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inline math $ e^{\pi i} + 1 = 0 $, and display math:&lt;/p&gt;

\[\sum\limits_{k=0}^{n-1} e^{2\pi ik/n} = 0\]

&lt;p&gt;Since math use \$ symbol at start/end of math input, to display \$ outside of code block, use two backslash to escape it, i.e. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;\\$&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;Footnotes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: if you need this footnote section text, you have to include it by your self at the end of each page.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:filepath&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;path to this file: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts/2016-03-19-markdown-examples.md&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:filepath&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:strike&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;strike is a kramdown feature. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:strike&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:footnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;footnote is kramdown specification. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:footnote&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:linenos&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;please do not use &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;{% highlight &amp;lt;lang&amp;gt; [linenos] %}&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:linenos&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
